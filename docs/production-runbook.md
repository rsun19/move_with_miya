# Production Runbook

## Deployment prerequisites

1. Point the production domain and `www` behavior to the host.
2. Provision a trusted certificate and key, and set `TLS_CERT_FILE` and `TLS_KEY_FILE` in the deployment-host environment file.
3. Register the exact HTTPS Google OAuth callback URL.
4. Restrict Turnstile to the production hostname.
5. Verify the Resend sending domain and configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.
6. Register the Stripe webhook at `/api/checkout/webhook`.

The populated environment file must live outside the repository with restrictive file permissions (`chmod 600`).

## Application stack

`docker-compose.prod.yml` builds images tagged `move-with-miya/<service>:${RELEASE_VERSION}`. Each service's Prisma migrations run as a one-shot `*-migrate` job, and the service only starts after its job completes successfully. Every service exposes `/health/live` and `/health/ready`; Compose healthchecks use the readiness endpoint, and nginx only starts once the services behind it are healthy.

nginx terminates TLS, redirects HTTP to HTTPS, and blocks the internal `/metrics` endpoints. It resolves upstream addresses at startup, so reload it (`nginx -s reload`) after recreating application containers.
